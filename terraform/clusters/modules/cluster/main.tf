# ── Kubeconfig parsing ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The Akuity provider installs agents into the cluster itself, so it needs
# working credentials at plan/apply time.
#
# ASSUMPTION / GOTCHA: this module reads embedded client certificates
# (client-certificate-data / client-key-data) from the kubeconfig. That covers
# k3d, kind, minikube, k3s, and most on-prem distros. Managed-cloud kubeconfigs
# (EKS/GKE/AKS) usually use an exec plugin (aws/gke-gcloud-auth-plugin/kubelogin)
# instead — those have no cert data to extract. For such clusters, export a
# kubeconfig with static credentials (e.g. a service-account token) or extend
# this module to pass `token` in kube_config.
